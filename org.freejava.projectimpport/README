USAGE
------

Create, and export your plug-in as "test.myapp_1.0.0.jar". Then you can use it as follows:

 1. Copy test.myapp_1.0.0.jar to your Eclipse/dropins/ folder
 2. Copy all needed plug-ins to the target workspace directory:

    cp -r projects/* NewWorkspace/

 3. Import needed projects into the workspace:

    eclipse -nosplash -application test.myapp.App -data NewWorkspace -import /path/to/NewWorkspace/project1 -import /path/to/NewWorkspace/project2 etc...

 4. Now, you can safely remove test.myapp_1.0.0.jar from the Eclipse/dropins/ folder.
